# Sass for Wordpress

"Sass for Wordpress" enables you to use Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) in your Wordpress project. I'm [Roy Tomeij](http://roytomeij.com/) by the way, and I write awesome Sass for [SliceCraft](http://www.slicecraft.com/).

## WARNING

This code hasn't been touched in about two years. There may be bugs thay may or may not be fixed anytime soon :)

## What does it do?

"Sass for Wordpress" enables you to use Sass ([Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets](http://sass-lang.com/)) and Compass in your Wordpress project. It has support for Sass and SCSS syntax.

## Installation

First, you need to have the Sass and Compass gems installed on your server to use the plugin. Please have a look at the Sass website for [installation instructions for Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html).

Second, your PHP version needs to be 5+ and shouldn't run in safe mode. We need to use the exec() function to run the command line tool to transform Sass into CSS (don't worry, we escape malicious input).

If you're sure you have done the above, you are ready to go (syntax below)!

Thanks to Marcus Cobde (https://github.com/leth) for his input.

## Changelog

### 1.2

Refactored the plugin to use `compass compile` instead of `sass`, so Compass can (and has to be) be used.

### 1.1

After not maintaining this plugin for about two years I made it work on the latest Sass version (3.1.5) and WordPress version (3.2.1). It may still work on older versions, but this is what I tested with.

### 1.0

Initial release.

## Usage/syntax

Simply refer to your Sass/Scss file by using the sass('filename') function. For instance, to use a style.sass file in your theme directory (which will be transformed into style.css), put this in your head:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo sass('style.sass'); ?>" type="text/css" media="screen" />`

The plugin expects your Sass files to always reside in the root of your theme directory.
